This repository contains teaching material for the [3rd International Summer School on Non-Targeted Metabolomics Data Mining for Biomedical Research](https://en.ssi.dk/news/events/summer-school-on-non-targeted-metabolomics-data-mining-for-biomedical-research).

## Exercise

Non-invasive drug monitoring is desirable as it improves patient experience. Instead of relying on invasive blood draws drug pharmacokinetics and metabolism could for example be monitored through the skin. During the summer school, you will be working with a subset of the data published by [Panitchpakdi and collaborators (2022)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0271794). The datasets consists of plasma and skin swabs (forearm, forehead and upper back) collected from healthy volunteers (n=7) over the course of 24 hours, who have been administered the antihistaminic diphenhydramine. Your task will be to investigate whether:

- Diphenhydramine and its metabolites can be detected in the skin and whether it exhibits similar pharmacokinetics as in plasma?
- You can observe other metabolites that exhibit interesting time trends in plasma and whether those metabolites can also be detected in the skin?

## Data

Metabolomics mass spectrometry data are publicly available in the open .mzML/.mzXML format at:

Students are divided into two groups. Group 1 will be working with skin samples collected from the forehead, whereas Group 2 will work skin samples collected from the forearm. Both groups 
will be investigating whether their respective skin samples could be suitable for non-invasive drug monitoring by comparing them to the plasma samples collected from the same individuals. 
Example notebooks and analyses are based on skin samples collected from the upper back. 

## MZmine 3

Preprocessed data are available in the subfolders [data/mzmine_output](https://github.com/ssi-dk/CD-MRG-metabolomics_summerschool_2023/tree/main/data/mzmine_output). [We added some placeholders for now, MZmine 3 team, please replace with the corresponding outputs for 
downstream analysis]
